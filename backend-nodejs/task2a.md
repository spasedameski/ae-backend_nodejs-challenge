One possible architecture for this task could involve a combination of several technologies.

Data storage: We would need to store the emission-related data in a database. One possible option for this is a NoSQL database such as MongoDB or Cassandra, which are both designed to handle large amounts of data and provide good support for flexible querying and filtering.

API layer: We would need an API layer to expose the data to clients. There are two main options here: REST or GraphQL. REST is a more traditional API style, while GraphQL provides a more flexible and powerful way to query data. Depending on the requirements of the system, either option could be a good fit. One possible technology for building the API layer is Node.js, which provides a good balance between performance and flexibility.

Caching: To improve performance and reduce load on the database, we could use a caching layer such as Redis or Memcached. This would allow us to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the number of requests that need to hit the database.

Error handling: To ensure that errors are handled gracefully, we would need to implement error handling at every layer of the system. This would involve using appropriate status codes and error messages in the API responses, as well as implementing logging and monitoring to track errors and diagnose problems.

Aggregation: To aggregate data, we could use a combination of database functions and application logic. For example, we could use MongoDB's aggregation pipeline to perform complex queries and calculations on the data, or we could use a library like Lodash to perform calculations in the application layer.

Stream processing: To support streaming of data to third-party clients, we could use a technology like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ to provide a scalable and fault-tolerant messaging system.

I choose MongoDB, ExpressJS and RestAPI.
